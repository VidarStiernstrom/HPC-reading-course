# HPC-reading-course

This repo is used to organize a PhD reading course on HPC for PDE:s given at the division of scientific computing, Uppsala University in the fall 2020. The main goal is to develop an distributed matrix free finite difference code for solving PDE:s based on the SBP framework, and in the process study concepts related to HPC on distributed environments.

The project is outlined as follows:

1. Search for relevant literature on HPC computing in a distributed environment, and concepts relevant for finite difference methods.
2. Search for useful exisiting software libraries.
3. Decide on a representative problem. Implement the solver and develop tests, assuring correctness of the solver and measuring it's performance. If possible, make a comparison to (1.) a matrix-based version of the code, (2.) a Matlab version of the code.
4. Give an oral presentation or write a report on the results.
