# Hyperbolic-system-SBP-FD-solver

The main goal of the project is to develop an distributed matrix free finite difference code for solving systems of hyperbolic PDE:s based on the SBP framework. Parallelization is carried out using the PETSc library.


The repo was started to organize a PhD reading course on HPC for PDE:s given at the division of scientific computing, Uppsala University in the fall 2020.

TODO:
Describe code
Once the HPC reading course is complete, move acowave to a folder 'examples'
